## Backend Documentation: Sea Properties Platform (MERN Stack)

This document focuses on the backend of the Sea Properties platform, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, and Node.js).

**Tech Stack:**

* Express.js: Web framework for Node.js applications.
* MongoDB: NoSQL document database for storing property data.
* Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side execution.
* Mongoose (optional): ODM (Object Document Mapper) for simplified interaction with MongoDB.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-github-repository-url.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory
   npm install # or yarn install
   ```
3. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:backend # or yarn dev:backend
   ```
   The backend server will start on a designated port (check environment variables).

**API Endpoints:**

* **Property Management:**
    * `/properties`: Create, read, update, and delete property listings.
    * `/properties/search`: Search properties by various criteria.
    * `/properties/:id`: Get details of a specific property.
* **User Management (optional):**
    * `/users`: Register, login, and manage user data.
* **Authentication (optional):**
    * `/auth/login`: Login with credentials.
    * `/auth/register`: Register a new user.

**Database Structure:**

* **Properties Collection:**
    * Stores details of properties, including:
        * title
        * description
        * price
        * location
        * images
        * other relevant fields
* **Users Collection (optional):**
    * Stores user data, including:
        * username
        * email
        * password
        * other relevant fields

**Testing:**

* Unit tests for APIs using frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
* Integration tests to ensure API endpoints interact correctly.

**Deployment:**

* Deploy to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.
* Configure environment variables for database connection and other settings.

**Development Notes:**

* Follow coding conventions and best practices for Node.js and Express.
* Document your code with clear and concise comments.
* Use continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

* MongoDB Documentation: [https://docs.mongodb.com/](https://docs.mongodb.com/)
* Mongoose Documentation (optional): [https://mongoosejs.com/](https://mongoosejs.com/)

This is a basic template. You may need to modify it to reflect the specific features and architecture of your backend. Remember to keep it updated as your project evolves.
